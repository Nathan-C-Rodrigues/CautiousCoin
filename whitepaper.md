## Vision

Our vision is to build a decentralized ecosystem where every transaction echoes the wisdom of the Seven Guardians. A community that values knowledge, purpose, and responsibility.

## Lore Integration: The Seven Guardians

The mythology of Cautiouscoin is rooted in the fictional world of the Seven Guardians:

1. **Selor the Unspoken** – Guardian of Thought  
2. **Myra of the Still Blade** – Guardian of Peace  
3. **Kova the Unopened** – Guardian of Secrets  
4. **Varrik the Ember** – Guardian of Anger  
5. **Ivas the Patient** – Guardian of Time  
6. **Ryn the Diverter** – Guardian of Impulse  
7. **Kael the Archivist** – Guardian of Balance  

Each Guardian represents a core principle and is reflected in the long-term design of the CAUT token ecosystem.
