            Long before Cautious Coin was forged, before the Vault of Echoes sealed its final chamber, there were the <strong>Seven Guardians of Logic</strong>. Each one held a fragment of CAUT’s original essence — not to control it, but to protect it.

          <p>Their names are lost to time, but their principles remain.</p>

                He was mute by choice, and his memory perfect. Selor carried the burden of forbidden knowledge without ever writing or speaking it. His coin glows only in the presence of lies.

            <br />
            Each Guardian disappeared after fulfilling a single silent mission. It’s said that when the <strong>Last Architect</strong> awakens and proves mastery over all seven forms of restraint, the fragments of CAUT will unite — and the <em>Vault of Echoes</em> will open.
