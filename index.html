      <h2>🦉 Selor the Unspoken – <em>Guardian of Thought</em></h2>
      <blockquote>The wisest action is the one not shared.</blockquote>
      <p>Mute by choice with a perfect memory. Selor bore forbidden truths in silence. His coin glows when lies are present.</p>

      <h2>🛡️ Myra of the Still Blade – <em>Guardian of Peace</em></h2>
      <blockquote>She won every duel... by never drawing her sword.</blockquote>
      <p>Restraint made her invincible. Her coin freezes time, but only for peacemakers.</p>

      <h2>🔒 Kova the Unopened – <em>Guardian of Secrets</em></h2>
      <blockquote>She sealed the world’s deadliest truths, even from herself.</blockquote>
      <p>Erased her mind to protect the world. Her coin deciphers any cipher at the cost of precious memory.</p>

      <h2>🔥 Varrik the Ember – <em>Guardian of Anger</em></h2>
      <blockquote>He once burned cities… until he chose to become cold.</blockquote>
      <p>He walked across frozen lands to kill his wrath. His coin’s ember burns only when vows are broken.</p>

      <h2>🕰️ Ivas the Patient – <em>Guardian of Time</em></h2>
      <blockquote>He waited three centuries to speak… and only said one word.</blockquote>
      <p>He saw futures and chose silence. His coin can bend time, but it costs years of life.</p>

      <h2>🌀 Ryn the Diverter – <em>Guardian of Impulse</em></h2>
      <blockquote>She mastered chaos to redirect it toward purpose.</blockquote>
      <p>She defended cities with illusions. Her coin only deflects when used to protect others.</p>

      <h2>⚖️ Kael the Archivist – <em>Guardian of Balance</em></h2>
      <blockquote>He holds the Book... but never opens it without asking why.</blockquote>
      <p>The record keeper of all. His coin logs all CAUT movements but demands a price of influence for access.</p>

      <h2>🔚 The Last Gathering</h2>
      <p>The Seven vanished after one mission each. When the Last Architect unites their restraint, CAUT’s fragments will open the Vault of Echoes.</p>
      <blockquote>They were not symbols of power, but of choice. Their silence is the echo that still guides us.</blockquote>
