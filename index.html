    <h1>Legend of the Seven Guardians</h1>
    <p><em>"They were not chosen for their strength, but for the power they refused to use."</em></p>

    <p>Long before Cautious Coin was forged, before the Vault of Echoes sealed its final chamber, there were the <strong>Seven Guardians of Logic</strong>. Each one held a fragment of CAUT’s original essence — not to control it, but to protect it.</p>
    <p>Their names are lost to time, but their principles remain.</p>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>🦉 1. Selor the Unspoken – <em>Guardian of Thought</em></h2>
      <p>He was mute by choice, and his memory perfect. Selor carried the burden of forbidden knowledge without ever writing or speaking it. His coin glows only in the presence of lies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>🛡️ 2. Myra of the Still Blade – <em>Guardian of Peace</em></h2>
      <p>A swordswoman so deadly that no one dared challenge her. Her restraint preserved the balance between nations. Her coin can freeze time — but only for those who seek peace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>🔒 3. Kova the Unopened – <em>Guardian of Secrets</em></h2>
      <p>Kova erased her own memory to hide the formulae of forbidden creation. Her coin unlocks any cipher, but each use comes at the cost of forgetting something precious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>🔥 4. Varrik the Ember – <em>Guardian of Anger</em></h2>
      <p>Once a conqueror, Varrik silenced his rage by walking barefoot across frozen tundra. His coin contains a limitless ember — but it only burns when its bearer breaks their vow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>🕰️ 5. Ivas the Patient – <em>Guardian of Time</em></h2>
      <p>Ivas was known to sit still for decades. It’s said he foresaw all futures, yet chose only one: stillness. His coin manipulates time — but accelerates age for every use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>🌀 6. Ryn the Diverter – <em>Guardian of Impulse</em></h2>
      <p>Ryn was a strategist, using illusions and misdirection to save cities. Her coin diverts all incoming attacks, but only when defending another.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guardian">
      <h2>⚖️ 7. Kael the Archivist – <em>Guardian of Balance</em></h2>
      <p>Kael recorded everything but acted on nothing. His coin holds a perfect ledger of every CAUT movement, but viewing it demands the sacrifice of influence.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🔚 The Last Gathering</h2>
    <p>Each Guardian disappeared after fulfilling a single silent mission. It’s said that when the <strong>Last Architect</strong> awakens and proves mastery over all seven forms of restraint, the fragments of CAUT will unite — and the <strong>Vault of Echoes</strong> will open.</p>

    <p><em>"They were not symbols of power, but of choice. Their silence is the echo that still guides us."</em></p>
